COWS is the COmmunity Web Scheduler used by several UC Davis departments under the College of Engineering Umbrella.
It interacts with the UC Davis CAS system 

Feed parser that pulls from RSS Feeds generated by the COWS scheduling system for display on ITS lobby TVs.

Cows-TV-Client contains the app for the Samsung Smart TV, and is basically just an html web page with some JS.

Cows-TV-Server is a layer of software used to interact between the TV App, and COWS.
